	- they get smaller as the number increases
	- can change the font size with the style atribute:
		- style="font-size:60px;"

	- makes the text "this is a link" a hyperlink
	- the "href" sets the link, like a class atribute

- images are <img src="fileName" alt="link(site, idk)" width="string number" height="string number">
	- src is an atribute that defines the image
	- these can be reletive or absolute urls
	
	- alt specifies what text will be in place if the image doesnt exist
	- use float atribute to tell it where to float on text, value can be left or right

intergrating css:
	Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
		what ive already done <h1 style="background-color:black;">heading</h1>
	Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
		defines the css style for the whole html page:
		
		<style>
		body {background-color: powderblue;}
		h1   {color: blue;}
		p    {color: red;}
		</style>

	External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file
	link to another css file to formate the whole page
	can be written like a json file like:

		body {
  			background-color: powderblue;
		}
		h1 {
  			color: blue;
		}
		p {
  			color: red;
		}

	to intergrate it:
	<head>
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
	</head>

css elements:
	border:
		makes box around text
	padding:
		set how much space there is between border and text
	margin:
		set the space from border to text, (moves text right)
opening links:
	The target attribute can have one of the following values:

		_self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
		_blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
		_parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
		_top - Opens the document in the full body of the window
		ex: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">Visit W3Schools!</a>

		to use image as link just put the <img> tag inside the <a> tag
	link to email:
		Use mailto: inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program (to let them send a new email)
		EX:<a href="cooperjbower@gmail.com">Send email</a>

	use button as link:
		you have to use java to determin what happens when th button is clicked
		ex: <button onclick="document.location='default.asp'">HTML Tutorial</button>

	the title atribute is a tooltip that shows when hovering over it
	can use css to give it color

creaing bookmarks(not the normal browser ones):
	use the id atribute to create it (creates almost a variable name for the heading, paragraph, etc)
	then use the href atribute and the name to get to it, ex: <a href="#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a>, to get to it

using the<script> tag you can use jave to make functions, and call them onClick

can set background images for paragrps or headers with style="background-image:(url "link to image");"
images will reapeate if to small, use bakground:"no-repeat"
to cover all of it use, background-size: cover, setting it to 100% 100% will stretch
also set the background-attachment to fixed

picture element:
	holds different images
	can set the different images to show depending other atributes

add icon:
	add the <link> tag after the <title> tag
	should be like rel="reletive path" type="image/x-icon" href="path to file"
